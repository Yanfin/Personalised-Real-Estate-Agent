Code name: HomMatch

The code is created to satisfy the project requirements as outlined below:

Synthetic Data Generation
    Criteria 1 - Generating Real Estate Listings with an LLM
        openai gpt-3.5-turbo is used to generate a list containing 15 properties.
        the list is then parsed for easy embedding.
        
Semantic Search
    Criteria 2- Creating a Vector Database and Storing Listings
        openai text-embedding-ada-002 is used for embedding
        the parsed list is then combined with embeddings ready for next step.
        
    Criteria 3 - Semantic Search of Listings Based on Buyer Preferences
        1st of all, a lancedb table is created 
        the table is then converted to pandas dataframe 
        a simple user interface is created for collecting user preference
        user preference is then parsed and embedded
        lancedb table.search funtion with metric "cosine" is used to conduct sementic search
        top 2 properties are returned
        
Augmented Response Generation    
    Criteria 4 - Logic for Searching and Augmenting Listing Descriptions.
        This has been demonstrated in previous steps.
    
    Criteria 5 - Use of LLM for Generating Personalized Descriptions
        1st of all, sementic search results are converted to natual language sentences.
        openai gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct is used to rewrite the sentences to a more personalised and tailored property descriptions.
        3 additional messages are also included for further personalisation.
